== Contributing

PRs are welcome.

=== Committing

This repository is set up with AngularJS commit message convention.
Pre-commit hook will invoke interactive prompt, powered by Commitizen,
that will ask you for information and put together a commit message for you.

To follow the convention:

* Only use ``git commit`` when making commits
* Don’t use built-in IDE commit prompts, since they may bypass prepare-commit-msg hook

=== Pushing

There is a pre-push Git hook that compiles the app.
This helps us catch compilation errors before code reaches CI.
